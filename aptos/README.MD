# Todo List Contract on Aptos

There are 2 versions

- simple todo list: each user can only have one todo list, stored directly under user's account
- complex todo list: each user can have multiple todo list, each todo list is stored under an object owned by the user

## Env setup

We usually use Intellij with Move plugin to develop Move smart contract.
VS Code has a move plugin, but it's not fully functioning yet.
