# Move by Examples

This repos contains a list of Move examples built on Aptos. Some of the examples are accompanied with a Solana version or a Solidity Version to help developers from other ecosystems to have a better comparison. Check out each example's readme for more details.

We also have [Aptos Learn](https://learn.aptoslabs.com/examples) which contains overview of Aptos and Move and more step by step tutorials.

We covered topics like

- Create single contract app.
- Define custom data structures.
- Define read and write endpoints for your contract.
- Emit event.
- Create token.
- Cross contract call.
- Write unit test.
- Deploy contract to testnet.
- Create Move script to atomically calling multiple functions.
- Interact with the contract using TypeScript SDK.

See both subdirectories' readmes for more details.
